# Binary Tree Traversal Guide

## Overview
This repository provides a detailed guide and implementations of various binary tree traversal methods. The primary goal is to help you understand and efficiently implement tree traversal algorithms in Python.

## Traversal Methods (Iterative & Recursive)
- **Pre-order Traversal (NLR)**
- **In-order Traversal (LNR)**
- **Post-order Traversal (LRN)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/macallister-crane/Binary-Tree-Traversal_Methods.git
